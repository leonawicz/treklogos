Star Trek logos

Compilation of Star Trek logos used for testing programmatic image-derived color palette modeling (see [here](https://leonawicz.github.io/imgpalr/) for details). All logo artwork credited to Kris Trigwell. This is a back up from [st-minutiae[(http://www.st-minutiae.com/resources/logos/) to avoid repeated server image requests.
